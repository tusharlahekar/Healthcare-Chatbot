# Healthcare Chatbot

This project is a healthcare chatbot that predicts potential diseases based on the symptoms provided by the user. The chatbot uses machine learning models such as Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes to deliver accurate predictions. Built with Flask, it offers an easy-to-use web interface for users to input symptoms and receive instant health insights.

## Features

- **Machine Learning Models**: Includes Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes classifiers for disease prediction.
- **Interactive Web Interface**: User-friendly web-based UI built using Flask.
- **Dynamic Predictions**: Accepts symptoms as input and predicts diseases with real-time processing.
- **Comprehensive Dataset**: Trained on an extensive medical dataset for high accuracy.

## How It Works

1. User inputs their name, age, and symptoms through the web interface.
2. Selects the desired machine learning model for prediction.
3. The chatbot processes the input and predicts the likely disease.
4. Returns the result in a clear and concise format.
